# jtrack

Your companion research tooling =)

## Purpose

To keep track of browser searching, and to visually link 
and relate similar pages together when browsing:

- during job searches
- noting down infomation for research writing
- keeping track of webpages information during coding

Everything is strictly kept on the local browser's instance, and nothing is stored
on the cloud so your data, is strictly privately yours :D
